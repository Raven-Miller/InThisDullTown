# How Do They Deal With Pain?

### Prompt

Character twisted their ankle. They're sitting alone in their room with the door closed. They couldn't tell anyone about their injury. If anyone knew, they'd question what Character had been up to. They couldn't afford that. Not then.
They pulled up their pant leg slightly to inspect the wound.

### Edith

Edith sat on her bed. She did her best to keep breathing in deep as she inspected the wound. She couldn't see any visible injuries, but it hurt a lot. She hugged her pillow as she tried to figure out what to do. She tried to move it -- that was a big mistake. She started crying on the spot. She bit her lip to stay quiet and lay back on her bed. She carefully pulled out her phone, and with shaky hands she looked up what to do.\
She did her best to walk to the kitchen. She kept biting her lip as she tried to ignore the pain. It was like nothing she had ever experienced; it felt like someone was wringing her ankle out like a towel. She wanted to yell. She wanted to scream and curse and cry. But she couldn't.\
She clenched her jaw tight as she grabbed a plastic bag and filled it with ice. Edith glanced at her mom laying on the couch; she looked asleep.

Walking back to her room was a struggle, but somehow she managed. When she got back, she collapsed on the bed. She buried her face in her pillow and let herself cry. Just 3 minutes. She had 3 minutes, and then she would compose herself.\
When her 3 minutes was up she took a shaky breath and rolled over on her back. Edith rested her foot on her pillow and put the ice on it.  
"You're gonna be okay. It'll be okay." she murmured to herself as she sniffled. She grabbed her phone and did her best to distract herself.

### Morgan

_She was fine. She was fine. She had to be fine._\
Morgan gritted her teeth as she lay in her bed. A twisted ankle is not that serious. She can handle this.\
She had her leg propped up on a pillow. It hurt. It hurt a lot. But she couldn't let herself feel it. If she felt it, she would break. And she really couldn't afford that.\
So she stayed in her room and dealt with the pain. Any time she moved it it hurt like hell. So she didn't move it.\
She really wished she could allow herself to cry. Could allow herself to ask for help. But she just couldn't. If it was anyone else, she would be there: holding their hand and taking care of them. But it wasn't anyone else. It was her. And she couldn't give herself a break.

She hugged her pillow as she tried to fall asleep. Everything in her body ached, her ankle felt like it was on fire, and her mind was reeling from the events that led her here. Hopelessness began to overcome her, but she chided herself — she was going to fine. It was going to be fine.

She screwed her eyes shut as she used all her willpower not to cry.

### June

June looked at their ankle. They couldn't see anything wrong with it. So why did it hurt so badly?\
They made a small whimper as they tried to move it.  
They really should tell someone. June shook their head at the thought. They couldn't.

Sitting there was pretty much their only course of action. They slumped against the wall with misery as they hugged their stuffed rat plushie, Gerard.\
"We're gonna be okay, right?" they mumbled, making small noises of pain as they tried to figure out how to sit.  
Everything in their body hurt. They were exhausted. Their throat was dry.

June moved to the water bottle on their nightstand. They gasped in pain as they put the tiniest bit of weight on their ankle.  
“Okay, let’s not do that.” They whispered to themselves.

They grabbed their water bottle and took a small sip. The water felt like golden light going down their throat. It was cool and fresh.  
They took a deep breath as they tried to relax.
“I’m gonna be fine. It’ll pass.” they occasionally reassured themselves. “I’ll just have a lie-down, and I’ll feel better.”

The sleep was full of aching and bad dreams, but it passed the time well. And June really needed it.

### Alex

Alex gasped in pain as he tried to move his ankle. It hurt. Everything hurt.\
He clutched at his pillow for support as he tried to breathe.

He cracked little jokes to no one as he tried to cope with the pain. He chuckled at the horrible aching of his leg.\
He knew he was alone. He didn't have to put on a brave face. But he did anyway. He had to joke — he had to laugh at himself. It was the only way he knew how to deal with this kind of stuff.

Alex has twisted his ankle before. When he was 12, he fell off his bike. He remembered the pain. The confusion, the frustration. He didn't see anything wrong with it. So why did it feel like he was going to die?

He shook off the memory. He couldn't focus on that. Not now. He took a couple of deep breaths to soothe himself. He lay back in bed, allowing himself to feel the pain for a little bit. Not too long. He knew if he took too long, he wouldn't be able to come back up.  
He stared at the ceiling as he let the agony wash over him. He groaned in pain, his jaw unconsciously tensing.

Time slipped his mind as he lay there, thinking about how he was going to handle this.  
What was he going to do?

### Ben

The pain was enough to make him cry. Ben lay face down on the floor, his head buried in the carpet.\
He could hear his dad's voice echoing in his head, telling him he had to get up. Real men didn't cry. Be a man.

The events of the day played in his head over and over — the voices distorted in his head, making them swirl around the room in a dizzying wall of noise.

He forced himself to stand up and move to the bathroom. He rifled through the medicine cabinet until he found the ibuprofen. He took 2.\
He dragged himself back to his bedroom and sat down against the wall. The floor helped him. Kept him grounded. Sane.

He didn't want to fall asleep. He couldn't imagine how bad the nightmares would be. He didn't feel like distracting himself. He needed to feel it. So he just sat there, staring into space.\
How was he going to be able to keep his mouth shut?
