          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>In This Dull Town is an adventure horror fiction project.</p>
          <p>
            It follows a band of 5 teens investigating the paranormal
            experiences of their hometown, Pine Ridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was first created January 2025 and made available to the public
            in July 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              The project doesn't work in linear time. There is no 1 set
              sequence of events. There is no defining beginning and end. It's a
              messy collection of stories from the main characters.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not that serious, this is just a silly little project that I'm
            doing for fun. So, please bear with me.

            I started this when I was 13, and I built it from the ground up. In
            fact, this website was coded by me, by hand.

            <li>I have a lot of creative hobbies</li>
            <li>I'm homeschooled, which gives me the time to do all of this</li>
